# Keycutter SSH Config - https://github.com/mbailey/keycutter/config

# SSH Config for improved SSH Key security supporting:
#
# - SSH Keytags naming convention: e.g. github.com_mbailey@work
# - SSH Key Privacy: Define which keys to offer to remote hosts.
# - SSH Agent Profiles: Define which keys to forward to different remote hosts.
# - SSH over SSM: Automatically copy public SSH key to AWS EC2 remote hosts.
# - Support for multiple service accounts (e.g. GitHub.com)

# Load custom rules for hosts (that override or append to directives below).
# Hidden files (starting with '.') are automatically excluded by SSH
Include keycutter/hosts/*.conf
