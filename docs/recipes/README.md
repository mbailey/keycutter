# Keycutter Recipes

This directory contains standalone, task-focused guides for accomplishing specific goals with Keycutter.

Each recipe provides clear, step-by-step instructions for a single task, making it easy to:
- Set up a new configuration
- Solve a specific problem
- Implement a particular workflow

Unlike the broader documentation, recipes are:
- Self-contained
- Goal-oriented
- Focused on practical implementation
- Designed to be followed from start to finish

For a curated guide to these recipes and related documentation, see the [Keycutter Cookbook](../cookbook.md).
