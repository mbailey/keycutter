# Keycutter How-To Guide

A practical guide to using Keycutter for SSH key management and authentication.

## Getting Started

- [Create your first FIDO SSH key](../README.md#quick-start)

## Common Tasks

### Creating and Managing Keys
- Create a new FIDO SSH key: `keycutter create <ssh-keytag>`
- [SSH to a remote host](recipes/ssh-to-host.md)
- [Add SSH key to GitHub](../README.md#quick-start)

### Configuration and Analysis
- [Analyze SSH config for a host](recipes/ssh-config-impact.md)
- Update Keycutter: `keycutter update`
- Check which keys would be offered: `keycutter authorized-keys <hostname>`

### YubiKey Setup
- [Set up a YubiKey with PIN protection](yubikeys/fido2-on-yubikeys.md)
- [Using YubiKey Manager (ykman)](yubikeys/ykman-yubikey-manager.md)
