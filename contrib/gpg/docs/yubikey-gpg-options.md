# GPG

"We need to talk about GPG" - Mike

from Claude.ai

You've raised an interesting and complex question about managing your personal intellectual property across multiple devices with different trust levels. Let's break down the pros and cons of using a single GPG key versus separate keys for each device.

Using a single GPG key across all devices:

Pros:
1. Simplicity: Easier to manage one key across all devices.
2. Consistency: All encrypted files can be decrypted with the same key, regardless of which device you're using.
3. Key distribution: Simpler to share your public key with others if you only have one.

Cons:
1. Security risk: If one device is compromised, all your encrypted data across all devices is potentially at risk.
2. Limited granular control: You can't easily restrict access to certain files on specific devices.
3. Revocation challenges: If you need to revoke the key due to a compromise, you'll need to re-encrypt all your data with a new key.

Using separate GPG keys for each device:

Pros:
1. Improved security isolation: A compromise on one device doesn't immediately threaten data encrypted for other devices.
2. Granular control: You can encrypt different files for different devices based on your trust level and needs.
3. Easier key management in case of device loss or compromise: You can revoke a single key without affecting others.

Cons:
1. Complexity: Managing multiple keys and remembering which key is for which device can be challenging.
2. Potential access issues: If you need to access a file on a different device, you might not have the correct key available.
3. Key distribution: You may need to share multiple public keys with others, which can be confusing.

Given your situation, using separate GPG keys for each device seems to be the better approach. Here's why:

1. Security boundaries: You've already identified that you have different trust levels for each device. Separate keys reinforce these boundaries.

2. Risk minimization: By using separate keys, you minimize the risk of exposing all your encrypted data if one device is compromised.

3. Intellectual property protection: For your personal and work-related intellectual property, having separate keys allows you to maintain better control over who can access what.

4. Flexibility: You can always encrypt important files with multiple keys if you need access across devices.

To implement this approach:

1. Generate a separate GPG key pair for each device.
2. Use descriptive names for each key to easily identify which is which.
3. Consider using subkeys for each device, with a master key stored securely offline.
4. Implement a system for categorizing your files and determining which key(s) to use for encryption.
5. Regularly backup your keys and keep the backups secure.
6. Be prepared to manage multiple public keys when sharing with others.

Remember, while this approach minimizes risk, it doesn't eliminate it entirely. Always be cautious about what you store on devices you don't fully control, and consider additional security measures like full-disk encryption where possible.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this setup or key management?
